      <description>As a continuity of first week, I get into learning of making a dynamic website.
Goal The goal is to create a basic todo web application. For this, you need to have some basic understanding and knowledge of handling HTML and CSS, Python and its dependencies, Database application.
Status Right now, I learned how to use HTML without CSS to show some basic content in a browser with help of Python with one of its dependency Flask.</description>

      <description>I am Renganathan, a graduate mechanical engineering student studying at Rochester Institute of Technology, New York, USA. I am from India. I love to live a natural life.
I learned this very lesson of sharing things with others all through my life.This blogging site is created in the aim of sharing the information which will be helpful for someone at some point. I am an amateur but interested in learning the computer science.</description>

      <description>This is my first week I wrote week notes for my blog. In this week I learned so many information about creation of a web application.
First I learned that there exists two types of website. One is static site and another one is dynamic site. The difference is the contents in the static website are preloaded and only managed by client side whereas in the dynamic sites it can also done through the server side.</description>

      <description>Design of CVD end caps and membrane holder (Apr 2020)
An altered design for existing CVD endcaps to make it easier to use and a new concept design of membrane holder for nanobiotechnology applications were done using Fusion 360 on my independent study.
Design of a RC car (Apr 2020)
Design of a RC car was done using Fusion 360 for the 3D printing process to implement CAD knowledge and to learn the science and mechanical aspects behind different 3D printers.</description>

      <description>Courses taken in Spring semester=&amp;gt; CGPA: 3.3 1. Introduction to Optimal Design=&amp;gt; Grade: B+ In this coursework, I learned the optimization techniques which will help to achieve better results in some real world problems. For example, take a car. While thinking, the common design variables which meet customer expectations are fuel efficiency, lifetime, and safety. Specifically saying the break efficiency is a design variable that helps to achieve better fuel efficiency and safety of the car but there are some constraints like profit, loss, and environmental considerations that determine the line between customer satisfaction and sales of a company.</description>
