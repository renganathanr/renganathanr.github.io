      <description>Weeknotes-05242020 This is my first week I wrote week notes for my blog. In this week I learned so many information about creation of a web application.
First I learned that there exists two types of website. One is static site and another one is dynamic site. The difference is the contents in the static website are preloaded and only managed by client side whereas in the dynamic sites it can also done through the server side.</description>

      <description>Renganathan&amp;rsquo;s Personal Website The reason behind the creation of this site. I like a famous saying &amp;ldquo;Knowledge is the power&amp;quot;. Now we are all on Internet age. So with the help of current interface, I would like to share my knowledge to everybody.
I have a plan of making small scale applications using Python in the backend and Markdown in the frontend and I am using the Hugo, a static site generator for creating this website.</description>
