SQLite learning process The website uses a good strategy (Spaced Repetition system) to teach the required content and only 16 lessons are free. So it takes the whole week to progress through the free lessons.</description>

      <description>This is my first week I wrote week notes for my blog. In this week I learned so many information about creation of a web application.
First I learned that there exists two types of website. One is static site and another one is dynamic site. The difference is the contents in the static website are preloaded and only managed by client side whereas in the dynamic sites it can also done through the server side.</description>
