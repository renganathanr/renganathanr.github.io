<h2 id="1-introduction-to-optimal-design-grade-b">1. Introduction to Optimal Design=&gt; Grade: B+</h2>
<p>In this coursework, I learned the optimization techniques which will help to achieve better results in some real world problems. For example, take a <strong>car</strong>. While thinking, the common design variables which meet customer expectations are fuel efficiency, lifetime, and safety. Specifically saying the break efficiency is a design variable that helps to achieve better fuel efficiency and safety of the car but there are some constraints like profit, loss, and environmental considerations that determine the line between customer satisfaction and sales of a company. This coursework helps me to learn some techniques which are best practiced in the market for better results.</p>
<p>MATLAB is a main tool that I used in this coursework to do the itertive computing that saves a lot of time and to minimize the human error.</p>
<p>Techniques like Kuhn-Tucker method, Bisection method, Powell&rsquo;s method, Cubic search method, Golden Section method, Steepest Descent method, Fletcher Reeves method, Davidson-Fletcher-Powell method (DFP), Broydon-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method (BFGS), Newton&rsquo;s method, Exterior Penalty Function method, Extended Interior Penalty Function method, Augmented Legrangian method (ALM), Sequential Linear Programming method, Method of Center (MOC), and Method of Feasible Directions (MFD) are all learned through this coursework.</p>
<p>Not all these methods come under the same category. Of these methods Kuhn-Tucker, Golden Section, Newton&rsquo;s, ALM, MFD are quite some popular methods used in the market.</p>
<h2 id="2-advanced-engineering-mathematics-grade-a">2. Advanced Engineering Mathematics=&gt; Grade: A</h2>
<p>This course structured into three parts. In the first part, I learned the topics like vector fields, line integrals, double integrals, and Stoke&rsquo;s theorem. In the second part, operations on complex numbers and in the third part operations on matrices are learned.</p>
<h2 id="3-3d-printing-grade-b-">3. 3D Printing=&gt; Grade: B-</h2>
<p>In this coursework, the science and the mechanisms behind the various 3D printing process are learned. It is also called as <strong>Additive Manufacturing</strong>. It is different from the traditional manufacturing process. In the traditional manufacturing process the unnecessary materials are removed from the parent material while in this method materials are added or joined together to form a required object. Thus it saves a lot of resources, time, and manpower.</p>
<p>3D printing processes like Material extrusion, Material jetting, Vat photopolymerization, and Powder bed fusion are learned through this coursework. In the end, a project of designing an RC car using Fusion 360 and preparation of CAD files for 3D printing was done.</p>
<p>The applications of 3D printing start growing in the mechanized world. Some of the important applications like prototyping, parts replacement in less numbers, and complex geometry part design makes the 3D printing most preferrable than the traditional method.</p>
<h2 id="4-independent-cad-study-grade-a">4. Independent CAD study=&gt; Grade: A</h2>
<p>In this coursework, I learned the parametric CAD workflow from the basic to the advanced level using Fusion 360. The structure of this coursework is in first, I selected to learn the basics through some tutorials provided by the Autodesk community and in the end, two CAD projects were assigned by my advisor.</p>
<p>First project is designing an existing CVD endcaps system which is difficult to use and the second one is designing a membrane holder which holds the nano-scale membrane used in biomedical applications undergoing various chemical tests.</p>
