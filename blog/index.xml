      <description>This week I spent most of my time on learning the Flask, a micro web framework of Python. Other than that I spent sometime to watch contents, read news, and have a walk with my house owner.
Flask Learning Reason I have a wish to do something with computers and one of its outcome is to create a web application. For that I selected Python as my OOP language and its micro web framework Flask.</description>

      <description>In this week, I learned less amount of things related to web development. Last week I created a basic todo webapp in order to perform its primary purpose and found many unknown Flask syntaxes in it. So I learned those unknowns and debug my webapp.
Debugging 1. Identify and show a warning message if empty string entered into task content form In first when I created the app by following the Youtube tutorial - Learn Flask for Python - Full Tutorial.</description>

      <description>This week I learned the basics of sqlite database with the help of a website named execute program and its link - Basic working with SQLite and simultaneously created a basic todo webapp using a Youtube tutorial - Learn Flask for Python - Full Tutorial.
SQLite learning process The website uses a good strategy (Spaced Repetition system) to teach the required content and only 16 lessons are free. So it takes the whole week to progress through the free lessons.</description>

      <description>In the previous week I learned the creation of a static site. This week I moved on and learned to make a dynamic website.
Goal The goal is to create a basic todo web application. For this, you need to have some basic understanding and knowledge of handling HTML and CSS, Python and its dependencies, Database application.
Status Right now, I learned how to use HTML without CSS to show some basic content in a browser with help of Python with one of its framework Flask.</description>

      <description>This is my first week I wrote week notes for my blog. In this week I learned so many information about creation of a web application.
First I learned that there exists two types of website. One is static site and another one is dynamic site. The difference is the contents in the static website are preloaded and only managed by client side whereas in the dynamic sites it can also done through the server side.</description>

      <description>Courses taken in Spring semester=&amp;gt; CGPA: 3.3 1. Introduction to Optimal Design=&amp;gt; Grade: B+ In this coursework, I learned the optimization techniques which will help to achieve better results in some real world problems. For example, take a car. While thinking, the common design variables which meet customer expectations are fuel efficiency, lifetime, and safety. Specifically saying the break efficiency is a design variable that helps to achieve better fuel efficiency and safety of the car but there are some constraints like profit, loss, and environmental considerations that determine the line between customer satisfaction and sales of a company.</description>
